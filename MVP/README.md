# MVP of Stroke_Prediction

In this folder, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is provided. 

The initial steps in detail are provided in the Jupyter notebook. 
The data explored in addition to the EDA workdlow process. 

## The MVP notebook summarizes the following: 
- Explore the features 
- Drop any unnecessary features
- Clean the text of the tweets
- Create one-hot-encoding for the vaccine type
- Label the data using ```Stroke```  ```feature```
- Train and test a ```Logistic Regression``` model to classify the data and got ```00.00%```


The following figure illustrates the ratio of stroke and non-stroke:

## There are a few more steps to finish the project: 
- Balance the dataset 
- Use different models to predict stroke.
